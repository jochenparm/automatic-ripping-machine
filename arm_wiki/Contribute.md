# Contributing Guide
## Introduction
Thank you for contributing to the Automatic Ripping Machine.

## Issues, Bugs, and Feature Requests
If you find a bug, please delete the existing log for that rip,
change the log level to DEBUG in your arm.yaml file and then run the rip again to get a clean log for analysis.  You can drag and drop the log onto an issue comment to attach it to the issue.

Also, since ARM relies on software such as a HandBrake and MakeMKV,
try running those programs manually to see if it's an issue there.
If you run ARM in DEBUG mode you should
be able to see the exact call-out to each program.

When submitting a bug, enhancement, or feature request please indicate if you are able/willing to make the changes yourself in a pull request.

## Making Code Changes

To make changes to the code, fork this project into your own GitHub repository.
Make the changes to the code, to implement the feature, or bug fix.
More information can be found in the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).

Once the new feature or bugfix has been incorporated,
test your changes locally to the best of your ability to ensure no new bugs have been introduced.
See [Testing](#Testing) for more information.

If significant changes have been made to ARM, ensure the following:
- Update the README file in your PR
- Update the ARM Wiki, see [ARM Wiki](http://github.com/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine/wiki/Contribute-Wiki)

## Raise a Pull Request

Once your code is ready, raise a new Pull Request (PR) within Github from your fork to the ARM main branch.
For additional information, see the [GitHub Docs](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)

To make it easier on the Developers reviewing any PR, avoid creating massive changes to the code base in one PR.
Where possible, try to reduce changes to a small feature or bug fix for easy review.

ARM versioning follows the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) standard.
All versions follow the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH numbering format recorded within the [VERSION](https://github.com/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine/blob/main/VERSION) file.
When developing changes, versioning should follow this format and be reflected within the file.

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

The GitHub actions will auto manage versions when creating raising a PR.
To allow this to happen, ensure the title includes the below text:

- MAJOR - not automatic, managed by core developer team
- MINOR - [FEATURE] PR descriptive title
- PATCH - [BUGFIX] PR descriptive title

On submitting your PR,
GitHub will automatically run multiple checks against the code and report back on the code quality.
Should any issues be identified with the code,
resolve them against the same branch used to raise the PR and push to GitHub.
GitHub will do the rest, re-running all tests.

## Hardware/OS Documentation
The installation guide is for Ubuntu20.04/Debian Buster/OMVault(debian) and the devs run it in VMware, however, many are running ARM in different environments.
If you have successfully set ARM up in a different environment and would like to assist others, please submit a howto to the [wiki](https://github.com/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine/wiki).

## Testing

ARM is written to meed the Python style guide PEP8 (https://pep8.org/. On submitting a new PR to ARM, the new and modified code will be checked against PEP8 for compliance.
Prior to loading up a new PR, it is recommended that the new or modified file within the PR be run through PEP8 (now pycodestyle).

The ARM Devs have developed some usefull tools for testing and scripting some of the development process.
Check out the [ARM Development Tools (devtools)](https://github.com/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine/wiki/Contribute-DevTools)

### Setting up pycodestyle

 You can install, upgrade, and uninstall pycodestyle.py with these commands:

 ```
 $ pip install pycodestyle
 $ pip install --upgrade pycodestyle
 $ pip uninstall pycodestyle
 ```

 There’s also a package for Debian/Ubuntu, but it’s not always the latest version.

 Example usage and output

 ```
 $ pycodestyle --first optparse.py
 optparse.py:69:11: E401 multiple imports on one line
 optparse.py:77:1: E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1
 optparse.py:88:5: E301 expected 1 blank line, found 0
 optparse.py:222:34: W602 deprecated form of raising exception
 optparse.py:347:31: E211 whitespace before '('
 optparse.py:357:17: E201 whitespace after '{'
 optparse.py:472:29: E221 multiple spaces before operator
 optparse.py:544:21: W601 .has_key() is deprecated, use 'in'
 ```

 You can also make pycodestyle.py show the source code for each error, and even the relevant text from PEP 8:

 ```
 $ pycodestyle --show-source --show-pep8 testsuite/E40.py
 testsuite/E40.py:2:10: E401 multiple imports on one line
 import os, sys
          ^
     Imports should usually be on separate lines.

     Okay: import os\nimport sys
     E401: import sys, os
 ```

 Or you can display how often each error was found:

 ```
 $ pycodestyle --statistics -qq Python-2.5/Lib
 232     E201 whitespace after '['
 599     E202 whitespace before ')'
 631     E203 whitespace before ','
 842     E211 whitespace before '('
 2531    E221 multiple spaces before operator
 4473    E301 expected 1 blank line, found 0
 4006    E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1
 165     E303 too many blank lines (4)
 325     E401 multiple imports on one line
 3615    E501 line too long (82 characters)
 612     W601 .has_key() is deprecated, use 'in'
 1188    W602 deprecated form of raising exception
 ```
