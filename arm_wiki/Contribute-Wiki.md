# Contributing to the Automatic Ripping Machine (ARM) Wiki

Thank you for considering contributing to the Automatic Ripping Machine (ARM) Wiki! Your contributions help make ARM more accessible and user-friendly for everyone. Below are the steps you need to follow to make changes to the wiki:

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the Repository**: First, fork the main ARM repository to your GitHub account. This creates a copy of the repository under your account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original repository.

2. **Clone the Forked Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/arm.git
   ```

3. **Modify Wiki Files**: Navigate to the arm_wiki folder within your cloned repository. Here, you'll find the Markdown files corresponding to the wiki pages. Make the necessary modifications or create new Markdown files to add content to the wiki.

4. **Commit Your Changes**: Once you've made the desired changes to the wiki files, commit them to your forked repository. Use meaningful commit messages to describe your changes clearly.

5. **Push Changes to Your Fork**: Push the committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command:

    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

## Creating a Pull Request (PR)

1. **Navigate to GitHub**: Visit the GitHub page of your forked repository in your web browser.

2. **Create a Pull Request**: Click on the "New Pull Request" button. GitHub will compare the changes between your fork and the main ARM repository. Ensure that the base repository is set to the main ARM repository.

3. **Review Your Changes**: Review the changes you've made in the pull request. Provide a clear description of the changes and any relevant context.

4. **Submit the Pull Request**: Once you're satisfied with the changes, submit the pull request. Your changes will be reviewed by the maintainers of the ARM project.

5. **Review and Approval**: The maintainers will review your pull request and provide feedback or request further modifications if necessary. Once approved, your changes will be merged into the main ARM repository, and the wiki will be updated for all users to see.

Thank you for your contribution to the ARM project! If you have any questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers.
